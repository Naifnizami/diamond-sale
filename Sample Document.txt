Only repository collaborators can edit a public repository's wiki by default,
but you can allow anyone with an account on GitHub.com to edit your wiki.
You can use a wiki to share detailed, long-form information about your project.
Wikis are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and
private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server.
